# Grand Central Terminal transportation by weather

This project represents a final assignment for Introduction to Data Visualization (COMS W 4995 006) taught by Agnes Chang at Columbia University. 

We decided to visualize how temperature and weather impacts public transportation usage around Grand Central Terminal in New York City. We were inspired by the recent resolution to adopt congestion pricing in the city. This will likely force even more people onto an already taxed public transportation system.

We collated data for (WIP)



We selected four days that we believed could represent a general range of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in New York City. In order to control for changing in commuter behavior throughout a given week, all the days we selected were Wednesdays. We also avoided holidays.

The four days we selected and their relevant weather information are as follows: 


| Day        | Temperature (°F) Hi/Lo   | Precipitation  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| January, 3rd, 2018     | 30°/16° | 0 in. |
| March 21st, 2018     | 39°/31°     |  0.99 in. of rain 8.2 in. of snow |
| June 27th, 2018 | 73°/66° | 0 in. |
| August, 29th, 2018 | 92°/81°  |  0 in. |
