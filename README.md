# Grand Central Terminal/Times Square transportation by weather

## Purpose

This project represents a final assignment for Introduction to Data Visualization (COMS W 4995 006) taught by Agnes Chang at Columbia University. The final product can be viewed [here](https://aaronbrezel.github.io/Grand_Central_Terminal/). Layout is best viewed on a large monitor.

We chose to visualize how temperature and weather impacted public transportation usage around Grand Central Terminal and Times Square in March 2018. We were inspired to explore this topic after completing an earlier assignment where we visualized pedestrian crossings of the Brooklyn Bridge and saw a notable decrease in winter months. That D3.js visualization and the associated writeup is viewable on Observable [here](https://observablehq.com/@aaronbrezel/eleven-months-of-brooklyn-bridge-crossings-by-hour).

## Resources

- Citi Bike ridership data from Citi Bikes' system data [portal](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
- Cab and rideshare data came from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commision's [trip record data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
- Static and animated visuals developed using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
- Scrolling architecture comes from [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama).

_Ideally, we would have liked to include subway ridership data, but ultimately the data provided by the MTA proved to be too inconsistent for our short turnaround time.__
