# Grand Central Terminal transportation by weather

This project represents a final assignment for Introduction to Data Visualization (COMS W 4995 006) taught by Agnes Chang at Columbia University. The final result can be viewed [here](https://aaronbrezel.github.io/Grand_Central_Terminal/). Layout is best viewed on a large monitor.

We decided to visualize how temperature and weather impacts public transportation usage around Grand Central Terminal in New York City. We were inspired by the recent resolution to adopt congestion pricing in the city. This will likely force even more people onto an already taxed public transportation system.

We collated data from citibikes, cabs, and rideshares in NYC for March 2018. Then, we pared those down to just the area around Grand Central Terminal and Times Square. This gave us a manageable dataset with which to work.

We visualized transportation useage as a function of temperature in our main [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) visualization, and then compiled static graphs to show snow's effect on all three vehicle types.
